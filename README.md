## About Me:
Hi! My name is Miles and I am a first year MURP student concentrating in regional economic development and pursuing a certificate in data analytics. I come from a landscape architecture background and was first introduced to GIS in my undergraduate studies. My interests are many and wide-reaching but I am primarily interested in  affordable housing, economic development and environmental planning, and hope to focus my academic and professional career in the space where these sub-fields converge. 
## Course Description
The course is intended as both an introduction and in-depth dive into the world of spatial data science through Python. Geospatial analysis has primarily been conducted through proprietary software but has now been democratized - this course marks the start of this journey of freedom and exploration!
## Objectives for this Course:
I have a pretty solid grasp on coding in Python from a data science lens but hope to leverage the skills taught in this class to develop a firm understanding of the geospatial tools and packages that are available. My career goals revolve around becoming an urban data scientist (at least in some form) and I am excited of the prospect that this class offers in getting my closer to that goal. I am obsessed with story-telling through visuals and believe this class will help me take my abilities to the next level!
## Potential Project Ideas:
A project idea that I would like to carry over from my previous quarter is assessing the rent burden value by U.S. counties and generating a model that helps describe the variance across the underlying features. In studying California counties, rent burden was not successfully explained solely by the disparity between income and rent prices and I would like to continue this study to determine what variables help explain why some counties suffer from high rent burdens and why others are more resilient. I hope by the end of this class I can better tell the story of rent burden across the U.S. through visually striking maps!

I would also be interested in any projects that involve the following topics:
- Urban pollution, heat island, GHG monitoring
- Labor markets, industry growth
- Rental vs ownership percentages across regions
